## Installation

Run `git clone git@github.com:SprocketCreations/readme-maker.git` where you would like this tool installed. Then inside the newly cloned repo, run `npm install` to install all of Readme Maker's dependencies.

## Usage

Run `node index.js` and answer the prompts. Any prompts you leave blank will have their associated section omitted. If there are enough sections in the readme, a table of contents will be generated. Once done, you can find your readme file in the out folder.

## Demo

This section was added to the readme after it was generated using this very tool.
